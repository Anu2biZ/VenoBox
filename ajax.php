<h1>Ajax call</h1>
<?php echo '<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brotherâ€™s keeper and the finder of lost children.</p>
<p>And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.</p>
<p>And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>'; ?>
